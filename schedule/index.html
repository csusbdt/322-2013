	    <a id='footnote-1' href='#footnote-1-source' title='Return to source'>1</a>: Please note that writing a program to produce required behavior is not good enough for a full score in this class: you must also write code that is readable by humans.  Program readability is important because real-world programs are read over and over again in the process of fixing bugs and adding new functionality.
