# Getting Started

Welcome to CSE 322 "Web Programming". This class will serve as an introduction to the technologies, languages, concepts, and best practices used in modern web development.

Web development is a rapidly changing and growing field, with all developments grouped into two rough categories: **client side** and **server side**. In this class we will be discussing **client side** web development, which includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We will also cover [git](http://git-scm.com/ "git - Source Code Management"), a source code management system, and a small amount of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node.js"), a server-side platform for programming servers in Javascript.

Everything in the class will be deployed using Heroku. Please review the [documentation on getting going with Heroku](https://github.com/csusbdt/322-2013/wiki/Heroku "Getting started with Heroku").
