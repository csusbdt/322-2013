# CSE 322 Website

This is the repository for the CSE 322 website. It is made using Jekyll, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The site is currently being transitioned to Jekyll. When done, it will use the custom tag {% markmatter FILE_NAME %} to parse markdown files from the _content directory and turn it into HTML that is included in the various documents.

GitHub Pages does not allow custom plugins, and so all markdown content will have to be preâ€“converted locally before being pushed to the repository.
